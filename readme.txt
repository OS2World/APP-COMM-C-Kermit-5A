In case you didn't see today's Info-Kermit, version 5A is done: installed,
released, and announced.  Final edit number and date: 5A(188), 23 Nov 92.
There are a million things I never had time to do, and probably an equal
number of things shouldn't have, but did.

The C-Kermit 5A files are gone from kermit/sw/ and kermit/test/.  Now
they've replaced the old, old 4E ones in kermit/b/ on watsun, and they are
also on CUVMA for BITNET / EARN access via KERMSRV.  Changes since edit
185 (the last one announced to the C-Kermit list) are detailed in
kermit/b/ckc188.upd.

Thanks to all of you for so much help, so many contributions, reports,
suggestions, etc etc.  There's still time to refine the auxilliary files
-- docs, bwrs, hlps, build procedures, man pages, etc -- but we'll be
leaving the code alone for a while, barring any horrible bugs.

- Frank
